					<p>President Barack Obama<br>
					The White House<br>
					1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br>
					Washington, DC 20500</p>

					<p>Dear President Obama:</p>

					<p>The Maker Movement today encourages everyone to think of themselves as makers, and see themselves as producers, not just consumers.   The emergence of the Maker Movement as a social movement might be attributed to three drivers: </p>

					<ol>
						<li>The broad participation of makers who combine creative goals and technical skills to develop their own projects, some of which become products and lead to new businesses;</li>
						<li>The self-organizing nature of the movement shows how individual makers and small groups have acted at the grassroots level to foster making in their community and recognize its social and economic value;</li>
						<li>More children and their parents are recognizing that making provides a personal and social context for learning about science and technology and developing the practices and mindset that empower them to lead productive and meaningful lives.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Maker Faire has been a catalyst for bringing together makers and connecting them in communities in America and throughout the world.  The number of events and the size of them continues to grow each year, inviting new people of any age to become makers.   The number of makerspaces continues to expand in cities and rural areas across the country, and they play an important role in providing an on-ramp to the maker community.  At the same time, there are new tools such as 3D printers and new platforms that support collaborative production that make it easier for more and more people to make things.   All this accounts for the growth of the maker movement.</p>

					<p>As individuals, as members of families and community groups, and as makers, we want to help support the continued growth and impact of maker movement in our community and in America.  We want to ensure that more and more people have access to the tools, materials and mentorship that allows them to develop as makers.   We want our communities to develop a thriving maker ecosystem that takes advantage of new opportunities in manufacturing, education, innovation and design. </p>

					<p>As the White House prepares to hold its first-ever Maker Faire, we are committed to working with others in our community and with institutions to advance one or more of the following goals to promote Making, including:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>To foster a local community of makers who participate in events, workshops, and outreach to grow a vibrant local maker community that is open and inclusive.</li>
						<li>To create and sustain makerspaces that serve all youth in our community.  We recognize the need for makerspaces in schools, libraries, museums and other community-serving organizations.</li>
						<li>To provide mentorship and support for students to develop projects that support the engaging, hands-on learning in the classroom and outside class.<br></li>
						<li>To help organize school-based Maker Faires that showcase student projects for the local community;</li>
						<li>To provide mentorship and support for makers who are starting new businesses or expanding existing businesses;</li>
						<li>To recognize and celebrate makers as well as the contributions of those who organize the local maker community.</li>
						<li>To participate in local and regional efforts to create a productive Maker ecosystem that involves companies, investors, skilled volunteers, state and local officials, libraries, museums, schools, after-school programs, labor unions, and community-based organizations.</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>We are working together to build maker communities throughout America and the world that introduce the maker movement to more people and expand the benefits that makers can realize through their participation. Thank you for your recognition of the maker community and its strategic importance for our future.  We look forward to working with you and your Administration to make this effort a huge success.</p>

				<h2>Presidential Proclamation &mdash; National Day of Making, 2014</h2>

				<h1>NATIONAL DAY OF MAKING, 2014</h1>

				<hr>

				<h3>BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</h3>

				<p><strong>A PROCLAMATION</strong></p>

				<p>Our Nation is home to a long line of innovators who have fueled our economy and transformed our world. Through the generations, American inventors have lit our homes, propelled humanity into the skies, and helped people across the planet connect at the click of a button. American manufacturers have never stopped chasing the next big breakthrough. As a country, we respond to challenge with discovery, determined to meet our great tests while seeking out new frontiers. During the National Day of Making, we celebrate and carry forward this proud tradition.</p>

				<p>Today, more and more Americans are gaining access to 21st century tools, from 3D printers and scanners to design software and laser cutters. Thanks to the democratization of technology, it is easier than ever for inventors to create just about anything. Across our Nation, entrepreneurs, students, and families are getting involved in the Maker Movement. My Administration is increasing their access to advanced design and research tools while organizations, businesses, public servants, and academic institutions are doing their part by investing in makerspaces and mentoring aspiring inventors.</p>

				<p>I am committed to helping Americans of all ages bring their ideas to life. Alongside our partners, my Administration is getting tens of thousands of young people involved in making. We are supporting an apprenticeship program for modern manufacturing and encouraging startups to build their products here at home. Because science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are essential to invention, we launched a decade-long national effort to train 100,000 excellent STEM teachers. And we are expanding STEM AmeriCorps so that this summer, 18,000 low-income students will have learning opportunities in these vital fields.</p>

				<p>As we observe this day, I am proud to host the first-ever White House Maker Faire. This event celebrates every maker -- from students learning STEM skills to entrepreneurs launching new businesses to innovators powering the renaissance in American manufacturing. I am calling on people across the country to join us in sparking creativity and encouraging invention in their communities.</p>

				<p>Today, let us continue on the path of discovery, experimentation, and innovation that has been the hallmark not only of human progress, but also of our Nation's progress. ￼ Together, let us unleash the imagination of our people, affirm that we are a Nation of makers, and ensure that the next great technological revolution happens right here in America.</p>

				<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 18, 2014, as National Day of Making. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, and activities that encourage a new generation of makers and manufacturers to share their talents and hone their skills.</p>

				<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand fourteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-eighth.</p>

				<p><strong>BARACK OBAMA</strong></p>
