I ended up using a knife to trim the tape off flush, then used a drum sander to remove the bulges and painted the edge black. Then masked the floor and cabinets with paper and let the second coat run over the edge so it\'s seamless and shiny. 

Next time, I would do it by picking an edge I wanted to be there permanently and applying it first, making sure it left an appropriate lip. Then I would do multiple layers with the goal of ending flush with the trim.',

In point of fact, the four-ounce cans of Clear Cleaner that I used are product #30779, but my understanding is that they contain the same material as #30805, and indeed the Oatey MSDS you\'ve linked to includes both product numbers.  The label on the #30779 cans I used lists Methyl Ethyl Ketone, Acetone, Cyclohexanone, and Tetrahydrofuran, in that order.  Oatey\'s MSDS, as you\'ve pointed out, only lists Methyl Ethyl Ketone and Acetone.  I\'m not sure why Oatey has not included cyclohexanone and THF on the MSDS.  I would be surprised if it\'s a mistake on their part, and suspect rather that the regulatory requirements for what must be listed on the MSDS, versus what must be listed on the product label, are different, and that Oatey is following the industry practice of providing the minimum amount of information required by law, in each case, in order to protect the formulation of their product.

It kinda took a life of its own after that.  The class goes through this step-by-step and leads up by building drawing tools in Processing that are later controlled by the box.  Here\'s a demo of a video mixer that uses the projBox:

Actually my projector is mounted on a 2\' piece of MDF shelving from the hardware store.  I\'ve drilled holes in the shelf and put bolts and washers through that secure the projector to the shelf using its built-in threaded mounting holes.  

The shelf, in turn, is mounted to the wall using \"Cable Shelf Brackets\" from The Container Store:

http://www.containerstore.com/shop/shelvingSale/wallMountedShelving/brackets?productId=10001032

The nice thing about these brackets, for this purpose, is that the shelf doesn\'t have to be mounted at 90 degrees to the wall.  You can stand under it and lift it up, eliminating tension on the cables, and then adjust the four corners up and down as you want to adjust the image, then let the shelf go, and gravity will hold it in place.  So it\'s easy to adjust.',

I would recommend going with something a little harder than we used - like the system 3 stuff, and I would *definitely* make sure you put down the marine varnish.

If was good enough condition that the property owner left it in place, and the new owners still adore it.  We have no kids, but we cook and we bake extensively, and it survived many, many parties and baking sessions with flying colors.

Warm items are okay, hot items are a definite bad idea.  We worked around it by keeping a felt bottomed granite sink cut out on part of the counter.  The felt kept the granite from scratching the surface, and was the perfect surface for hot stuff - we even use them to cool cakes and brittles.  

One of the best things about this in terms of durability is that it is infinitely patchable.  If it gets scratched up, all you have to do is sand it smooth and put down a new skim coat and it is as good as new - the epoxy fills the scratches in perfectly.',

Thanks for your comment.  I consciously chose to use a container with a screw-top lid to help alleviate the danger of the container popping loose from the lid, from which it is suspended, and falling into the empty space inside a hollow-core door.  If you have a solid-core door or the depth of the recess you cut doesn\'t penetrate beyond the solid upper rim of the door, this is not a concern.

In the case of PVC pipe, my experience is that the fading is caused by exposure to sunlight or other UV light, and that some colors fade more than others.  Light-fastness should vary with the particular dye molecules used to achieve a particular color.  I have not observed fading from commercial \"Purple Primer,\" which I\'m sure has been formulated using dye molecules that are more light-fast.  The dyes that I used here are intended for colorizing organic solvents (e.g. diesel fuel or denatured alcohol) and thus are not intended to hold up to prolonged UV exposure.  I\'m sure light-fast versions of all these colors could be prepared if a person could get his or her hands on the right bulk dye molecules, but sourcing them in small quantities may be a bit of a challenge.',

Here are a few things that you might want to look into:
 
Did Step 13 work OK? Were you able to blink the LED using the Serial Monitor? 
 
Did you try running the app with the Arduino plugged into the computer and with the serial monitor running? This will enable you to view part of the conversation between the cable and the Arduino, but will probably prevent the app from working (but it will be an instructive test). The goal here is to confirm that the iPhone is indeed sending the messages we think it\'s sending.
 
Have you run the Rsc Demo app that comes with the RedPark serial cable (see the Serial Cable SDK README)? There is a loopback test you can run in that app. You\'ll need to connect the loopback adapter that was supplied with the cable. This will let you confirm that the cable is working OK.
 
Also, one of our authors (the guy who turned me on to this all), has some good example code you might want to look at: http://www.dailyack.com/2011/07/connect-your-iphone-to-real-world.html

I have not calculated it, I just tried with some capacitors I had around :)

3) I used a 18ohm resistor to limit the current to what I think the LED can withstand without and extra heat sink. If you add a heat sink you can use a smaller resistor to the send more current to the LED, but never more than 500ma that is the current limit for the BC337 and also for the Arduino 5V I think.',

So try upping your circuits voltage a little bit. If that doesn\'t work, then adjust the resistor R10 in the bar graph schematic and/or R2, R7, and R11 in the filter schematic. Adjusting R10 increases the bargraph sensitivity, but may cause LED the leading LED\'s (Like LED 1, and LED2) to remain permanently on. Adjusting R2, R7, and R11 increases the AMP sensitivity, so it outputs a bigger waveform.

The Arduino serial monitor is software that runs on your computer, and must be connected to the Arduino to work, but if you follow this example, you need to connect the Arduino\'s built-in serial port to the iPhone. I don\'t think you can reliably send messages to both the computer and iPhone at the same time, so I would not advise trying this. If you must communicate with both an iPhone and a computer simultaneously, consider using an Arduino with multiple serial ports, such as the Mega, or consider using SoftwareSerial to communicate with the RedPark cable (I do now know if that is supported or if it is reliable though).

\"It is important that any copper connector to the anode not touch the solution. If it does, copper will oxidize to cupric ion, Cu++. The connector will be destroyed. Most of the copper ions formed should precipitate as copper carbonate or copper hydroxide, but if any of this dissolved copper reaches the cathode it will be reduced to copper metal on the iron object. Its presence will promote rapid rerusting.\"

Thanks for the tips on the both the vertical/horizontal stabilizer and the rubber band.  Good mods to the projects.  I\'m always looking for ways to simplify and design.  I haven\'t had issues with the staple holding the rubber band to the wing although you may add a little glue to the staple for extra strength.  As long as you\'re careful, it will work.  If you test other ways of doing this that work well, please post!  

The whole project will release in MAKE in the July issue.  Think of it as a version 1.0 with many mods to come.

Thanks again,

Rick',

Great to hear the build went so well.  I use a compressor as well when launching with a larger group as it\'s super handy to launch one right after another.  It looks like you have it set up to automatically recharge after each launch.  Thanks for sending the pics from your blog as well.  I enjoyed reading about your maker/life pursuits.  Like you, I take my greatest pride in being a husband and dad.

 This project has been a blast since I wrote it up a few years ago in MAKE #15.  I\'m stoked to have a new article just released on a folding-wing glider in MAKE #31.  The opening shot is of my son and I.  All the best and thanks again for posting.

There are a lot of online suppliers - Mcmaster.com, grainger.com, and so on, but they all charge a lot for clear pvc. I see this website that offers it for much less but I know nothing about them:

You can consider building it out of less dense and strong acrylic which is cheaper, but I can\'t vouch for how it sounds since I\'ve not tried it. A source for that is 
http://www.aquaticeco.com/subcategories/826/Acrylic-Tubing?green=447575FA-C464-5C26-B46F-4EBE5E54E181

You can glue or friction fit, depending on how sturdy you want it be and if you think you\'ll ever want to take it apart. I just friction fit and left it at that, except for attaching the speaker.

3. Use a fine toothed blade on your saw if you\'ve got one, although it doesn\'t much matter.

Sorry to be so unhelpful, but the answer to all of your questions is \"I don\'t really know!\"  My guess is that it will not work so well on Nylon, but I have not tried it and that is really just a gut instinct as opposed to any kind of reasoned guess.  You\'ll have to try it out for yourself!  But please do let us know.  I do have some experience storing these mixes:  They will keep, but you have to seal the cans very tightly, or the solvent will evaporate.  I use ParaFilm to wrap the can lids once I seal them.

The darlington array effectively operates as a digital switch.

This design uses a technique called \'PWM\' or pulse width modulation. Effectively the 555 produces an output that is switching on and off faster than you can see. By varying the potentiometer you change the relative amount of time the output is \'on\' for and hence adjust the apparent brightness of the LEDs.

The issue is the 555 can only sink a few miliamps of current, much less than what is needed to drive all those LEDs, so instead the 555 drives the darlingtons which take very little current to operate but can sink many times more than the 555. The darlington is basically like a relay.',

Also, most have no good way to drain & clean them, and while those aren\'t insolvable problems, they are a bit of PIA.

So I thought about it for a bit and realized that every kitchen already HAS a waterbath, it\'s just not rigged for temperature control (and it ought to be rigged for 25F-190F so you could heat or chill.)

The waterbath is usually called the sink. Easy to fill, easy to drain, easy to access, easy to clean.

All it needs is a heating/chilling unit and a thermostat control and a bit of insulation around the outside and perhaps a cover.

If you want to work around it, here is something you could try:

Get two OpAmps and set them op as a x10 chain in series with each other. This will give you a x100 gain(10x10) Then add the filter stage. That should work well, but it will not work as cleanly as having a class AB amplifier before it. There will be a lot more distortion in the output.',

Just saw your comment...  Thanks for the great tip on lining the pivot hole on the fuselage with plastic tubing.  I\'m going to give that a try.  A couple things in the original design that helped reduce the eating away of the balsa by the pivot-

1.  Make sure you use a little sandpaper (included in kit) to smooth the edges of the wing pivot.  

2. Add several thin layers of white glide to the pivot hole to strengthen the balsa where it rubs.  

Again, thanks for the helpful mod and glad you\'ve enjoyed the project!

Awesome build video and glad you\'re enjoying the project.  We just build ten or so gliders with some kids this past week and they flew great.  Good note on the horizontal stabilizer.  This seems to be where the damage happens when not getting it lined up correctly with the hand catapult.

Sorry your had some frustrations.  This guide is best if you are building this kit and launcher from scratch.  Literally thousands of people have built this and had a blast.  If you buy the kit, the ONLY additional things you need to provide are a bike pump or compressor, masking tape, two 9 volt batteries and pipe glue.  Everything else is included.  

If you are building from the kit, a new guide has been set up at: http://makeprojects.com/Project/Make%3A+Compressed+Air+Rockets+Kit/2235/1#.UJFUmW_R7K03

Perhaps this is actually a brushless DC motor which would put out 3 phase AC when it spins.  That would need to be rectified.  Given that there are only two wires coming out of the motor in the picture, I would suggest that it is not a brushless DC motor.  Basically the rectifier is just unnecessarily dropping the voltage that is coming from the motor by about 1.4 volts.  I would suggest that you don\'t need it.  Easy test, hook the motor leads up to a voltmeter set to test for DC voltages and spin the rotor.  If it shows a voltage then it is DC.  If not or if the needle wiggles back and forth then you have AC.',

I use a more complicated crank construction to leave the 5/16 bolt head free to use a cordless drill with a socket attachment.

One is safety; if the unit stands by itself, you will most certainly be tempted to set it down. If you absentmindedly leave it sitting for more than 30 seconds or so you risk fire and/or scorching the wood. Even when turned off the unit needs minutes to cool to safe levels. A unit that cannot be left in a dangerous position wont be. Another concern is the legs , especially 4 points, scratching the wood. The legs get real hot, and it\'s easy to make \"snail tracks\" or brandings in the wood if you\'re not careful. I typically remove the risers altogether when working so that nothing touches the wood. Another concern is that you typically should use this device vertically rather than horizontally. When vertical the device absorbs far less of its own heat. I worry a bit about horizontal use for extended periods. Fortunately, unless you\'re doing a floor,  most work can be positioned vertical. Lastly you mentioned weight. Every ounce really does count when holding this thing vertically. If you can be mindful of these risks and warnings, then you can perhaps experiment with some trestle style legs.  --Dave',

When making a mono speaker like this, the left and right signals get summed together. However, if at some stage during the construction, the polarity of either the left or the right channels is inverted, then anything in the centre, like the vocals, will get lost. This is because the vocals are now present as exact opposite signals on the left and right, and perfectly cancel out when summed. 

This phenomenon doesn\'t affect the instrumentation as they tend to be in different amounts on the left and right, and so do not cancel out when one side is subtracted from the other.

I can\'t help you with regards the specifics of the circuit (I haven\'t looked in detail at it yet), but a good place to start would be to look at the wiring of sockets and jacks - have you swapped a shield and a tip, for example?',

Did both your servos do this? Sometimes we get a bad one but have never gotten two bad ones at once. If both are doing it could be pointing to another problem. I have this set up on my desk right now and it\'s working fine unless I unplug the the POT1 to A0 connection. Definitely double check this wire and make sure that the pot is soldered correctly to the board. 

Additionally,if the jumper for the potentiometer is missing or not connecting it causes the same issue. Try removing the jumper and shorting the center pin with the 5V pin. If that fixes it you might try building up the pins a bit with some solder or just making a solder bridge on the bottom of the board so it\'s 5V all the time, which is fine for an Arduino.

Let me know how it goes!

For the type of reed switch I used, it closes when a magnet comes near. So if I need the lights to come on when the door opens, this will not work. We need to invert the logic here, which is why a transistor is used. 

If you instead use a reed switch which opens when a magnet comes near,  you don\'t need a transistor. But you need to make sure that the reed switch can handle the current when it is used in series with the battery and the LEDs.',

Just double check for me that you\'re not attempting to insert the diode into the hole where the 75k resistor should go - it does have thicker leads than the resistors do, and will not fit.

Here is some advice if you want to build your very own Drill Kart:

- Don\'t use wood to construct the frame. Ours ended up very heavy and was hard to transport. Instead, if you have the budget, make the frame out of aluminum square/rectangle tubing and bolt or weld the pieces together. You can still use plywood for the deck and wood blocks for the brakes, but try to make the kart as light as possible.

- Add a chain tensioner to your design. It was very hard for us to adjust the chain tension after we had put the chain on. Maybe create a system that allows you to pull the drills back in order to tighten the chains. 

- Our kart had quite a bit of torque even though the frame was so heavy. If you\'re on a budget, you can probably use cheaper drills or drills that are AC powered if you don\'t mind being tethered.

Good luck and take lots of photos to document it!',

We also machined the wing pivot out of round 3/8\" delrin barstock, and it swings very easily.  I would suggest that if this becomes an injection molded part in the kit in the future, it should be made round.  Also, I had some Ø0.045\" \"Spring Wire\" on hand that we used for the wing hinge, and it has been working great.

On Sunday, we built the catapult launcher - all I can say is WOW!  I thought that I had been conservative with stretch in the surgical tubing - until the plane nearly went out of sight, and landed 40\' up in a neighbor\'s tree...  Oh well - we were launching it in the middle of a snow storm, so I simply got it down with a few snowballs.  It then went clear over the house, into another tree, one time on the roof - good thing I have a roof-rake!',
